# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is a submission for the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on _Kaggle_.

## Overview

The goal of this competition is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, and passenger class. This repository contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a **logistic regression** model for prediction.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

Install the required dependencies: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn

### Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of 79% on the training data and 78% on the testing data.
